# Classic Snake Game 

A Python implementation of the classic Snake game using Turtle Graphics.

## Overview
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming and game development using Turtle Graphics.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple user interface
- Customizable game parameters

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Install all the files and run.
3. Use arrow keys to control the snake.
4. Eat red squares to grow; avoid walls and self-collision.

## Rules and Regulations
### Snake Movement: 
The snake moves continuously in the game area. The player can control the direction of the snake's movement using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or alternative controls.

### Eating Food: 
Food (usually represented by a colored square) appears randomly on the game board. When the snake's head collides with the food, it "eats" the food, and its length increases by one unit.

### Growing Length: 
As the snake eats food, its length grows longer. The player's score typically increases with each piece of food eaten.

### Collision Detection:

#### Wall Collision: 
If the snake's head collides with any of the walls surrounding the game area, the game ends.
#### Self-Collision: 
If the snake's head collides with any part of its own body, the game ends.
### Game Over: 
The game ends when either of the collision conditions (wall collision or self-collision) is met. Upon game over, the player can usually see their final score and may have the option to restart the game.

### Scoring: 
The player's score is typically based on the number of food items eaten by the snake. The score may be displayed on the screen during gameplay.

## Customization
- Adjust game parameters in different files.
- Modify colors, grid size, and snake speed to customize the game.

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects and music.
- Enhance graphics and animations.
